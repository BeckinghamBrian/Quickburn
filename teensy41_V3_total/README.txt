Sampling and state machine work with coms over serial
added 1 more data spot for the loadcell, this tripped the max sampling below 5k
high speed and low speed logging is working
this works with the gui sending commands
Minor sampling problem, some samples have irregular time splits ~20 per min on the order of 1000 sample splits
